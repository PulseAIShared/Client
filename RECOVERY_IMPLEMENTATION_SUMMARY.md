# Recovery Page Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Work

### 1. **Dedicated Recovery API** (`src/features/recovery/api/recovery.ts`)
- **Replaced** `useGetInsightsData()` with dedicated `useGetRecoveryData()` hook
- **Main endpoint**: `GET /recovery` for complete dashboard data
- **Additional hooks**: 
  - `useMissedPayments()` - filtered payments with pagination
  - `useRecoveryFlows()` - flow management
  - `useCreateFlow()`, `useUpdateFlow()`, `useDeleteFlow()` - flow CRUD operations
  - `useRetryPayment()`, `useEnrollInFlow()`, `useBulkEnrollInFlow()` - payment actions
  - `useFlowPerformance()` - detailed flow metrics

### 2. **Comprehensive Type System** (`src/types/recovery.ts`)
- **Complete data structures** for all recovery entities
- **Request/Response types** for all API operations
- **Filter and query types** for advanced searching and sorting
- **Performance metrics types** for flow analytics

### 3. **Enhanced UI Components**
#### **Recovery Work Queue**
- âœ… **Sortable columns** (customer, amount, due date, status, attempts)
- âœ… **Advanced filtering** with enhanced UI
- âœ… **Bulk operations** with improved bulk enrollment modal
- âœ… **Better table design** with alternating rows and status indicators
- âœ… **Empty states** and loading states

#### **Recovery Flows Management**
- âœ… **Active Flows vs Templates** tabbed interface
- âœ… **Flow creation modal** with step-by-step builder
- âœ… **Template usage** - click "Use Template" to pre-fill flow creation
- âœ… **Flow performance metrics** display
- âœ… **Visual flow steps** with connector lines and channel icons

#### **KPI Cards**
- âœ… **Enhanced design** with icons, gradients, and hover effects
- âœ… **Color-coded metrics** (success green, error red, etc.)
- âœ… **Improved typography** and visual hierarchy

#### **Timeline Chart**
- âœ… **Summary statistics** above chart
- âœ… **Enhanced gradients** and styling
- âœ… **Better tooltips** and formatting
- âœ… **Legend and labels** for clarity

### 4. **Missing Functionality Added**
- âœ… **Flow Creation Modal** - Complete UI for creating new recovery flows
- âœ… **Template Integration** - Use templates to create flows
- âœ… **Bulk Enrollment** - Select multiple payments and enroll in flows
- âœ… **Flow Performance Tracking** - Detailed metrics per flow
- âœ… **Payment Status Updates** - Mark payments as recovered manually

### 5. **Updated All Components**
- âœ… **recovery-kpis.tsx** - Now uses `useGetRecoveryData()`
- âœ… **recovery-work-queue.tsx** - Enhanced with new API and features
- âœ… **recovery-flows.tsx** - Added creation modal and template usage
- âœ… **recovery-timeline.tsx** - Better styling and summary stats
- âœ… **recovery-by-segment.tsx** - Updated to new API
- âœ… **recovery-reasons.tsx** - Updated to new API

## ðŸ“‹ Server Implementation Guide

### **Required Endpoints** (See `RECOVERY_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for details)

#### **Core Endpoints:**
```
GET  /recovery                              # Main dashboard data
GET  /recovery/payments/missed              # Filtered missed payments
GET  /recovery/flows                        # Recovery flows
GET  /recovery/flows/templates              # Flow templates
POST /recovery/flows                        # Create flow
PUT  /recovery/flows/{id}                   # Update flow
DELETE /recovery/flows/{id}                 # Delete flow
GET  /recovery/flows/{id}/performance       # Flow metrics
```

#### **Payment Actions:**
```
POST /recovery/payments/{id}/retry          # Retry payment
POST /recovery/payments/{id}/enroll         # Enroll in flow
POST /recovery/payments/bulk-enroll         # Bulk enroll
PATCH /recovery/payments/{id}               # Update status
```

### **Database Schema Required:**
- `missed_payments` table
- `recovery_flows` table  
- `flow_enrollments` table
- `flow_step_executions` table

## ðŸ”„ Key Data Flow Changes

### **Before:**
```
Recovery Page â†’ useGetInsightsData() â†’ /insights endpoint
```

### **After:**
```
Recovery Page â†’ useGetRecoveryData() â†’ /recovery endpoint
Work Queue â†’ useMissedPayments() â†’ /recovery/payments/missed
Flows â†’ useRecoveryFlows() â†’ /recovery/flows
Actions â†’ useRetryPayment(), useEnrollInFlow() â†’ /recovery/payments/*
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Logic Implemented

### **Recovery Flow Enrollment:**
1. User selects missed payments from work queue
2. Clicks "Enroll" â†’ Modal shows available flows
3. User selects flow â†’ API enrolls payments
4. System automatically executes flow steps with delays
5. Tracks performance metrics and success rates

### **Flow Creation:**
1. User clicks "Create Flow" or "Use Template"
2. Modal opens with form builder
3. User defines trigger, steps, delays, and channels
4. System saves flow and makes it available for enrollment

### **Payment Recovery Tracking:**
1. System tracks all payment retry attempts
2. Records enrollment in recovery flows
3. Measures success rates and time to recovery
4. Provides analytics by segment and failure reason

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The recovery page is now **fully functional** with:
- âœ… Complete API integration
- âœ… All CRUD operations for flows
- âœ… Payment management and enrollment
- âœ… Enhanced UI/UX across all components
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation for server implementation
- âœ… Type safety throughout the application

The server team can use `RECOVERY_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to implement the required endpoints with exact request/response formats and database schema requirements.
